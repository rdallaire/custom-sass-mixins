## Custom SASS Mixins

This is where I will collect usefull SASS mixins and other SASS files that I find usefull. I find that libraries like COMPASS and Burbon have a lot of things that I do not use. This repo will compile the things that I do find usefull.

### File Structure


`custom.global.scss` is where I plan on having variables saved

`custom.mixins.scss` mixins will live in this file until I need to start sorting them into multiple files
